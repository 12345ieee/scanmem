    * buffered overlapping peeks to improve scan performance.
    * automatically support chars, shorts and ints.
        - removed width command
    * pid command can change target.
    * = command, to accompany < and > to indicate variable has not changed.
    * snapshot command to enhance <, > and =. WARNING: experimental, very inefficient.
        - snapshot will use a more efficient format next version, right now it
          should not be used on large programs, or will eat all your free memory.

    * cleaned up some lintian errors
    * used __builtin_expect() to try to improve performance in some areas
    * minor UI tweaks, give region counts during scan.
    * start using readline(), should implement completion at some point.
    * fixed memory leak.

    * Improved usability of set, cont, list, etc.
    * Add progress meter, large programs can take a long time for initial scan.
    * Testing support for variable width targets, signedness not currenlty handled.
    * delete command to eliminate matches.
    * list command now shows where a variable is located.
