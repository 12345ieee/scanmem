* also search registers
* allow variable length integers, floats and doubles?
* improve command parsing in interactive mode
* dont exit after finding, allow more commands like set to 12, now set to 43, etc
* allow pseudo values, like `incremented since last time` `decremented since last time` etc.
* be more verbose about where the variable is, allow list command to eliminate variables
    * eg, if its from a library thats nothing to do with it, kill it.
* sometimes hitting enter several times eliminates more, why? can i run canddidates() until it stabilises?
    * probably timers or something
